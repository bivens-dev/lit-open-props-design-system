# Lit Open Props Design System
This repository is currently just a playground for me to explore a number of patterns that
might be useful when trying to build a design system.

This is currently based on an as yet [unreleased experiment](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/starter-design-system-max) in the [Lit repo](https://github.com/lit/lit) 
where the team is putting together a starter kit for a number of use cases (including a design system).

I've tweaked things slightly based on what was originally there to use [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) rather than [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) 
as I generally find the developer experience quite a bit nicer.

I've also decided to take a look at another really interesting project known as [Open Props](https://open-props.style/) from Adam Argyle. 
Open Props might initially feel kind of similar to something like Tailwind at first but has a number of really interesting advantages that it provides by using 
CSS custom properties over utility classes.

If you are interested in what that developer experience looks like I would suggest taking a look at some of these videos where he covers it in more detail.

So this repo is an attempt to bring together the best practices of how to build a design system using Lit as per the teams recommendations along with the really 
in-depth work Adam has put into Open Props.
